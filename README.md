# Intro to Data Science Project: Analyzing the NYC Subway Data Set #


**Author: Andrew Bauman PhD**

This is the final project for Udacity's Introduction to Data Science the first course in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  During the course we analyzed NYC subway data from May 2011.  We wrangled and interrogated the data and received an introduction to I/O methods. 

**Methods and tools of interrogation included:**

- SQL Queries
- Linear Regression/Gradient Descent
- Map Reduce
- PANDASfu, not to be confused with Kung Fu Panda


**The following narrative is my selected work from the course.  We will cover:**

- Data Wrangling
- Data Survey/Exploration
- Selected Data Analysis and Visualization
- Machine Learning

The most important part of science, including Data Science is asking the right question.  The question asked guides the analyst through constraint and scope.  This maximizes the potential for success while minimizing the chances of wasting resources (time, computational power) etc.  Formation of a sound hypothesis and testing that hypothesis is fundamental to any scientific pursuit.  

**Basic Question:** Does weather (i.e. precipitation, temperature, ...) impact subway use?

The data set we are using in this class (May 2011) is fairly limited in terms of ranges of values for factors such as temperature and pressure.  This limits our pool of meaningful analyses.  However, a single month is a great bite sized chunk for an introduction to Data Science skills, and to test methods and tools.  Success with this small data set can be modified and scaled to additional months and years of data.

**So what do we need to do to answer this basic question and related questions?**
Prior to exploring the data it is difficult to say exactly what approach we will take.  However, we do know that we will need to join subway and weather data.  Prior to doing this it is likely that we will need to clean, reshape, and harmonize either or both data sets.
